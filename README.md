# Exercise: cat
Write a program called cat that takes a filename as input and writes the content to `os.Stdout`.

Bonus:
* do it without buffering the file contents in memory.
* add a command line flag to change the output to `os.Stderr`. Hint: see package flag.
* add a command line flag to optionally print the size of the file at the end of the output.
